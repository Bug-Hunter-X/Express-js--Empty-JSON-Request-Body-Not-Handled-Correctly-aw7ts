# Express.js Empty JSON Request Body Handling Bug

This repository demonstrates a common issue in Express.js applications where empty JSON request bodies are not handled correctly. The server accepts the request but logs an empty object instead of providing meaningful feedback or error handling.  The solution shows how to correctly handle this case using middleware to check for the presence of a body.

## Bug

The `bug.js` file contains an Express.js application that attempts to handle JSON requests. However, when an empty JSON body is sent, it logs an empty object and responds with a success message, potentially leading to unexpected behavior. This is because `express.json()` doesn't produce an error when receiving an empty JSON request body.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a solution to this problem by introducing custom middleware to handle empty JSON bodies. The middleware checks if the request body is empty and responds with an appropriate error message in such cases.  This avoids the silent handling of empty requests and ensures robustness.
